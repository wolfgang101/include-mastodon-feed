= Additional customizations =

You can define several plugin constants to set custom default options that will be applied site-wide.

1. Open your `wp-config.php` file
2. Search for the line `/* Add any custom values between this line and the "stop editing" line. */`
3. Define the options you want to override between the line from step #2 and `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */`

See the included `config-example.php` file for a full list of supported settings.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I find my account ID? =
Please feel free to use [this handy lookup tool](https://wolfgang.lol/code/include-mastodon-feed-wordpress-plugin/)

To look your ID up manually there are several ways.

As an instance admin you can easily read your user ID in the admin backend.

As regular user you can try an API v2 search to find your ID.

**API v2 notes:**
* Change `example.org` to your instance
* Replace `username` with your handle.

Use the following URL to get your ID:

`https://example.org/api/v2/search?q=username@example.org&resolve=false&limit=5`
