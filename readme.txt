As an instance admin you can easily read your user ID in the admin backend.

As regular user you can try an API v2 search to find your ID.

**API v2 notes:**
* You might have to be logged in to get any results
* Change `example.org` to your instance
* Replace `username` with your handle.

Use the following URL to get your ID:

`https://example.org/api/v2/search?q=username@example.org&resolve=true&limit=5`
